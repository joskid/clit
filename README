Clit
=====

A very basic _command-line interface_ for Twitter for OSX, Linux and Windows (!).

Commands
-------

    get [n]             -- get most recent tweets
    search [string] [n] -- search for the specified terms
    post [text]         -- post tweet
    data                -- display oauth tokens

Usage
-----

You can have it two ways:

1. Just download the "compiled" executable for your platform available in /dist. Extract to a directory and run `./clit authorize`.
2. Clone this repo, run .ie. `./jsdb/jsdb_mac main.js authorize`;

Simply running `./clit` will give you the list of available commands.
